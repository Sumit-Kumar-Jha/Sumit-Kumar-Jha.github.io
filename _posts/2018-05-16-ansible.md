# Introduction
Jenkins is a software that allows continuous integration. Jenkins will be installed on a server where the central build will take place.
# Offline Installation
For installation of Jenkins in offline mode, you need two things:
* JRE Binary --> The binary which I have used is jre-8u172-ea-bin-b03-linux-x64-18_jan_2018.tar.gz
* Jenkins RPM --> RPM used is jenkins-2.89.4-1.1.noarch.rpm. It can be downloaded from the site https://jenkins.io/ .
# Method of installation
Execute the command  `tar -zxvf jre-8u172-ea-bin-b03-linux-x64-18_jan_2018.tar.gz`, in order to extract the file. Extract it under /usr/bin directory.
Assuming that, you are logged in with root user,setup the path in .bashrc file under /root directory,</n>
Like `PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/jre1.8.0_172/bin`
Then in .bash_profile, make entry for path variable, like `export PATH`
After that, set the path for Java in /usr/bin directory.
`ln â€“s /usr/bin/jre1.8.0_172/bin/java java`

It's the time now to install Jenkins
`rpm -ivh jenkins-2.89.4-1.1.noarch.rpm`
Once installed, you need to run the commands -->
`systemctl start jenkins.service` and
`systemctl enable jenkins.service`
Access your console using the url http://<your_server_ip>:8080

## Issues

* Error while execution of command `systemctl start jenkins.service`
  check if java path is set correctly, you can check using the command `java -version`.
  Secondly Edit `/etc/sysconfig/jenkins` ,  and in

Line number 48, change
`
`JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Djava.awt.headless=true"`
  to
`JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -Djna.tmpdir=/var/lib/jenkins/tmp`
`
