# Introduction
Ansible is simple open source IT engine which automates application deployment, intra service orchestration, cloud provisioning and many other IT tools.

Ansible is easy to deploy because it does not use any agents or custom security infrastructure.

## Installation
Best way to install the ansible is online, due to many dependencies of python and other packages.
If yum utility is present in your system, you can simply install using the command:


`yum install ansible`


The latest version of ansible is 2.5. Documentation for the same can be found at http://docs.ansible.com

## Offline Installation
Below packages are required for offline installation of Ansible <br/>
* PyYAML
* python-crypto
* python-httplib2
* python-jinja2
* python-keyczar
* python-paramiko
* python-setuptools
* python-six
* python2-jmespath
* sshpass <br/>
Now install using Ansible rpm <br/>
``` shell
rpm -ivh ansible-2.5.0-2.el7.noarch.rpm
warning: ansible-2.5.0-2.el7.noarch.rpm: Header V3 RSA/SHA256 
<br/> Signature, key ID 352c64e5: NOKEY

(  1%)################################## [100%]
```
Now check the version of ansible installed using command <br/>
```
ansible --version <br/>
Ansible 2.5.0
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = [u'/root/.ansible/plugins/modules
  ', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.5 (default, Nov 20 2015, 02:00:19)
  [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4)]
```
## Ansible CMDB
Ansible-cmdb combines information from the Ansible inventory and discovered facts to create a detailed HTML report akin to a Configuration Management Database.<br/>
To use it in your playbook dir, just create a directory to hold facts discovered by the setup module then generate the report<br/>
```shell
mkdir cmdb
ansible all -i hosts -m setup --tree cmdb/
ansible-cmdb -i hosts cmdb/ > cmdb.html
```
You can use Ansible CMBD with various options for creating the output.<br/>
```shell
ansible-cmdb -t html_fancy_split -p local_js=1 out/
open cmdb/index.html
```
By default all information (server list and all server information) is displayed on the same page, rendering could be a bit slow with lots of servers and columns.<br/>
Option “-t html_fancy_split” specifies a built-in template where server information is separated in several files and “-p local_js=1” store javascript in HTML (it's helpful for offline use).<br/>
It’s also possible to export host inventory to other formats like CSV or SQL.<br/>
```shell
ansible-cmdb -t csv out > overview.csv
```
## ARA (Ansible Runbook Analysis)
ARA Records Ansible playbook runs and makes the recorded data available and intuitive for endusers and systems.<br/>
ARA doesn't run your playbooks for you: it integrates with Ansible as a callback plugin wherever it is. </br>
Whether you are running Ansible from your personal laptop or a server, all you need to do is to install ARA, configure Ansible to use ARA and you're good to go.</br>

Install Dependencies: </br>

```shell
yum install gcc python-devel libffi-devel openssl-devel redhat-rpm-config
```
Installing ARA from latest release on PyPi </br>

```shell
pip install ara
```
### Configuration
To begin using ARA, you’ll first need to set up Ansible so it knows about the the ARA callback and, if necessary, the ara_record and ara_read modules.</br>
The callback and modules are bundled when installing ARA but you need to know where they have been installed in order to let Ansible know where they are located.</br>
ARA ships a set of convenience Python modules to help you configure Ansible to use it.</br>

```shell
$ python -m ara.setup.path
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ara

$ python -m ara.setup.action_plugins
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ara/plugins/actions

$ python -m ara.setup.callback_plugins
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ara/plugins/callbacks

$ python -m ara.setup.library
/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ara/plugins/modules
```
## Using ansible.cfg </br>
This sets up a new ansible.cfg file to load the callbacks and modules from the appropriate locations:</br>

```shell
$ python -m ara.setup.ansible | tee ansible.cfg
[defaults]
callback_plugins=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ara/plugins/callbacks
action_plugins=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ara/plugins/actions
library=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ara/plugins/modules
```
## TIPS
* Finding the file with .csv extension <br/>
```
 name: using find module to find the report.csv file
      find:
        paths: /tmp/execute-gen
        patterns: '*.csv'
      register: file_to_copy
```
* Fetching the same file(discussed in the point above) from destination server to target server <br/>
```
 name: Using fetch module to fetch the file from remote server
      fetch:
        src: '{{ file_to_copy.files[0].path }}'
        dest: /tmp/export
```
